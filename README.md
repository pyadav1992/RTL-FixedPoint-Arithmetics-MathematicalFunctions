# RTL-FixedPoint-Arithmetics-MathematicalFunctions
RTL design and implementation of fixed-point parametric arithmetic operators and mathematical functions using Verilog HDL

Designed and implemented fixed point parametric arithmetic operators and mathematical functions:
– Adder/Subtractor
– Multiplier
– Absolute square(Used to find the magnitude of a complex number)
– Logarithmic function(Base-2 and Base-10)
– Ceil (Rounding function)
– Leaky Integrator (Used for integrating abrupt input samples to generating a more consistent output)
– Ensemble Averager (Used to perform running average on ensembles of data)
